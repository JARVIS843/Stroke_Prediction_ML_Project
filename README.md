[Stroke Prediction using Neural Network](https://github.com/JARVIS843/Stroke_Prediction_ML_Project)
=========================================
---
## About:
[This project](https://github.com/JARVIS843/Stroke_Prediction_ML_Project) aims to predict whether an elderly person is likely to get stroke based on eleven distinct features such as gender, age, and diseases etc. The project trains binary classification neural network models using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), on Jupyter Notebook.

## Models:

If you would like to use our pre-trained models, all of them can be found: Here (TODO: Insert folder link here)

Below is a table delineating the specifications and performances for each model:
| Model Name     | Accuracy|
| --------       | ------- |
| Model A        | 80%     |
| Model B        | 90%     |
| Model C        | 98%     |

## Dataset Used:

All of the models for this project are trained using the [Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

---
## Authors & Background:

This project is co-developed by: [Jarvis Yang](https://github.com/JARVIS843), and [Jegyeong An](TODO: insert link here).

The project was intended to be the final project for the [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://github.com/sdrangan/introml) course, provided by Professor [Sundeep Rangan](https://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/).
